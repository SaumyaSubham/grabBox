Today I'm creating a complete responsive online food website using html, css and vanilla javascript. 
Unlike Zomato and Swiggy, It's a Indian local food website operating from local restaurant where we can order our dailylife based homely food.
It is one of my project of Web Development. If you want to check my other Web Developments projects, be free to watch it my other repos.

Here, I used some food images instead of any database to make it attractive ✔️✔️.

Well, the main feature of this website are:
✔ responsive header / navbar with toggle menu bar effect and search bar icon and scrollspy.
✔ responsive home section with touch slider using swiper.js
✔ responsive dishes card section using grid.
✔ responsive about section using flexbox.
✔ responsive menu card section using grid.
✔ responsive review section with touch slider using swiper.js
✔ responsive order form section.
✔ responsive footer section using grid.
